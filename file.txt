The rising average temperature of Earth's climate system, called global warming, is driving changes in rainfall patterns, extreme weather, arrival of seasons, and more. Collectively, global warming and its effects are known as climate change. While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming, observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale.[1]


Observed temperature from NASA[2] vs the 1850–1900 average as a pre-industrial baseline. The primary driver for increased global temperatures in the industrial era is human activity, with natural forces adding variability.[3]
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that "human influence on climate has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century". These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of major nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.[4] The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases, with over 90% of the impact from carbon dioxide and methane.[5] Fossil fuel burning is the principal source of these gases, with agricultural emissions and deforestation also playing significant roles. Temperature rise is enhanced by self-reinforcing climate feedbacks, such as loss of snow cover, increased water vapour, and melting permafrost.

Land surfaces are heating faster than the ocean surface, leading to heat waves, wildfires, and the expansion of deserts.[6] Increasing atmospheric energy and rates of evaporation are causing more intense storms and weather extremes, damaging infrastructure and agriculture.[7] Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic and have contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic. Surface temperatures would stabilize and decline a little if emissions were cut off, but other impacts will continue for centuries, including rising sea levels from melting ice sheets, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification from elevated levels of carbon dioxide.[8]

Some effects of climate change

Pest propagation. Mild winters allow more pine beetles to survive to kill large swaths of forest.


Countries work together on climate change under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which has near-universal membership. The goal of the convention is to "prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system". The IPCC has told policy makers that there is much greater risk to human and natural systems if warming goes above 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) compared to pre-industrial levels.[10] Under the Paris Agreement, nations are making climate pledges to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but those promises - assuming nations follow through - would still allow global warming to reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by 2100.[11] To limit warming to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F), methane emissions would need to decrease to near-zero levels and carbon dioxide emissions would need to reach net-zero by the year 2050.[12]

Mitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, forest preservation, as well as the development of potential climate engineering technologies. Societies and governments are also working to adapt to current and future global warming impacts, including improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops.

Recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes.[147] Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening, whereas heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear.[148] Global warming has contributed to the expansion of drier climatic zones, such as, probably, the expansion of deserts in the subtropics.[149] Without substantial actions to reduce the rate of global warming, land-based ecosystems risk major shifts in their composition and structure.[150] Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems.[151]

The ocean has heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles as fast as or faster than species on land.[152] Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds.[153] Ocean acidification threatens damage to coral reefs, fisheries, protected species, and other natural resources of value to society.[154] Coastal ecosystems are under stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts. Harmful algae blooms have increased due to warming, ocean deoxygenation and eutrophication.

The long-term effects of global warming include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. On the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic CO2 emissions.[137] This is due to carbon dioxide's very long lifetime in the atmosphere.[137] Carbon dioxide is slowly taking up by the ocean, such that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years.[138] The emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least 100,000 years.[139] Because the great mass of glaciers and ice caps depressed the Earth's crust, another long-term effect of ice melt and deglaciation is the gradual rising of landmasses, a process called post-glacial rebound.[140] Sea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of 2.3 metres per degree Celsius (4.2 ft/°F) after 2000 years.[141]

If global warming exceeds 1.5 °C, there is a greater risk of passing through ‘tipping points’, thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced.[142] Some large-scale changes could occur abruptly, i.e. over a short time period. One potential source of abrupt tipping would be the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost, which would amplify global warming.[143] Another example is the possibility for the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to collapse,[144] which could trigger cooling in the North Atlantic, Europe, and North America.[145] If multiple temperature and carbon cycle tipping points re-inforce each other, or if there were to be strong threshold behaviour in cloud cover, there could be a global tipping into a hothouse Earth.

The effects of climate change on humans, mostly due to warming and shifts in precipitation, have been detected worldwide. The social impacts of climate change will be uneven across the world.[160] All regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts,[161] with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk.[162] Regional impacts of climate change are now observable on all continents and across ocean regions.[163] The Arctic, Africa, small islands, and Asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future climate change.[164] Many risks increase with higher magnitudes of global warming.[165]

Global warming of around 4 °C relative to late 20th century levels could pose a large risk to global and regional food security.[166] Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative.[167] The impact for the four major crops was negative for wheat and maize, and neutral for soy and rice, in the years 1960–2013.[168] Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of hunger as a consequence of warming.[169] While increased CO
2 levels help crop growth at lower temperature increases, those crops do become less nutritious.[169] Based on local and indigenous knowledge, climate change is already affecting food security in mountain regions in South America and Asia, and in various drylands, particularly in Africa.[169] Regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands are also at increased risk of water stress due to climate change.
